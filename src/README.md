# A visual representation of the Suzuki-Kasami's Broadcast Algorithm for implementing distributed mutual exclusion

## Demo

The project is live on AWS Amplify at: https://master.d3nrzc077r7ovf.amplifyapp.com/

## Description

This project was done as part of the Assignment component under EC-1 for the Distributed Computing course in BITS Pilani, Semester 1.

## Steps to run the code

The code is written on React JS and scaffolded using ViteJS. So, we need to have npm in order to build it. It can run on static hosting though. There is no backend required as the business logic is written in the JS code itself.

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run preview`

The last command above will show the port on which the application will be running. Open it to access the web app.
