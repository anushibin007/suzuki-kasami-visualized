## Description

This project was done as part of the Assignment component under EC-1 for the Distributed Computing course in BITS Pilani, Semester 1.

## Language used

ReactJS for frontend.  
The algorithm is implemented in JavaScript.  
The output can be seen using a browser GUI.

## Main Code

The main code is present in the runAThread() function of src/App.jsx

## Steps to run the code

The code is written on React JS and scaffolded using ViteJS. So, we need to have npm in order to build it. It can run on static hosting though. There is no backend required as the business logic is written in the JS code itself.

1. npm install
2. npm run preview

The last command above will show the port on which the application will be running. It will usually be running on the port 4173. Open it to access the web app. For example, http://localhost:4173
